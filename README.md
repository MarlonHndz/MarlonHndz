### Hi, I'm Marlon! 👋

![Android Banner](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16215046/122137021-56219100-ce09-11eb-82fa-018fb5d04f39.jpg)

I am a software engineer passionate about Android, the growth of those around me and a ❣️ lover of technology, 🎵 music, anime and video games 🎮, if I may say that around here.😉✨

Some of the technologies I enjoy working with are Java, Kotlin and Gradle. I recently wrote a concept book 📘 for interviews, going through OOP, Android Components, Android Jetpack, Architecture Patterns, Kotlin, and more, which I'll be virtually posting on some blogs and linking here in the next few days ⏰ (When the cover design is finished :octocat:).
