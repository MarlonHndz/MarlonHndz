### Hi, I'm Marlon! ðŸ‘‹

Software Engineer and Android developer with over 8 years of experience in the world of technology. Since 2016, I have worked on high-impact projects for renowned international companies such as Disney, Globant, Dafiti, Backbase, REI.com, and Smile Direct Club, among others. My career has been characterized by my ability to face complex challenges, contribute to innovative solutions, and stay at the forefront of mobile technologies, particularly in the Android ecosystem.

Beyond the world of programming, I find inspiration in other passions such as music ðŸŽµ, anime, and video gamesðŸŽ®, which also serve as a source of creativity and innovation in my day-to-day life.
Convinced that knowledge grows when it is shared, I have written this blog to help other developers and technology enthusiasts master the basics of programming and harness its potential to develop efficient and elegant applications.
